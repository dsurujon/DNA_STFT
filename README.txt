This program uses a Short-Time-Fourier Transform method to demonstrate which parts of a gene are introns and which parts are exons. A sliding window of size 400 bases is used in conjunction with the DNA_FT algorithm, and the signal to noise ratio for each window is plotted. A more detailed description of this algorithm can be found in the following publication:
